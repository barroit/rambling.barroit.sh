You can copy this license text around as-is, but don't edit it.

This [filename] isn't code. It's creative work. It's not covered by GPL, MIT, or
any other open source license. It lives under Miku's Despotic Mandate License
v2.1 only.

Scope
=====

Creative work here means any medium or writing, along with their source files.
That covers stills, animations, video, 3D exports, and text posts. Like PNG,
JPEG, GIF, MP4, WebM, .blend, .obj, .fbx, .glb, .kra, .psd, .rst, .txt,
whatever. Basically, not code, but the stuff around it.

You can copy and redistribute this work anywhere, in any medium you want, as
long as you follow the rules below. you can't modify the work, except for:

1.	changing format or container (PNG to SVG, .blend to .glb, etc)

2.	scaling it bigger or smaller.

And even then, it doesn't make it yours. The work is still mine, and it stays
under this license.

Rules (follow them or fuck off)
===============================

1.	Include this license in your repo, workspace, or whatever project you
	dump the creative work into. SPDX-License-Identifier: LicenseRef-MDM-2.1
	is fine as a pointer, but the full text must be present somewhere. Just
	don't pretend it's unlicensed.

2.	Credit me, Jiamu Sun, loud and clear. If it's in a code repo, slap my
	name in the top-level readme file. If it's somewhere else, put it in
	equally user-facing docs. Don't do half-ass "hidden in a corner" shit.

3.	If you show this work on a website or any public showcase, you must
	attach my name to the thing in a machine-readable way. Example:

	  <div itemscope itemtype='https://schema.org/ImageObject'>
	    <img itemprop='contentUrl' src='miku.png' alt='Miku illustration'/>
	    <meta itemprop='copyrightHolder' content='Jiamu Sun'/>
	  </div>

	Don't skip this. Don't hide credit in fine print.

4.	This is non-commercial only. You don't get to slap it on a T-shirt,
	shove it in a product, or otherwise make money off it, directly or
	indirectly.

You may use this version of the license, or any later version published by me.
